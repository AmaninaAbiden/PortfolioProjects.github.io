This repository is dedicated for me to upload my personal projects on data analysis as part of my journey to become a data analyst.

The projects are both tutorials that I learnt from various Youtube videos and my own choice of dataset. So in case you found another repo in github with similar coding and project name,
that is most probably the tutorial creator.
